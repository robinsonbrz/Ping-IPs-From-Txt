# Ping IPs From Txt
Reads IP addresses from the "ip_list.txt" file and keeps pinging these addresses in a continuous loop.
This file can have any quantity of IP addresses.

If any ping is unsuccessful, the program writes the fail IP and time of fail on the "down_output.txt" file.

Very useful to check a constant connection in a network or website.
